## Built With
* **Symfony API** -  *is an Open Source web framework for API-first projects. Describe the API's data model or import an existing one from Schema.org and get instantly a fully featured read/write API with REST operations, data validation, pagination, sorting, filtering, Swagger documentation, an authorization system, invalidation-based HTTP cache, nested documents, content negotiation and support for modern hypermedia formats (JSON-LD, HAL and Hydra).*
* **MVVM** - *MVVM facilitates a separation of development of the graphical user interface – be it via a markup language or GUI code – from development of the business logic or back-end logic (the data model).*
* **Maven** - *Apache Maven is a software project management and comprehension tool. Based on the concept of a project object model (POM), Maven can manage a project's build, reporting and documentation from a central piece of information.*
* **Lombok** - *Lombok is used to reduce boilerplate code for model/data objects, e.g., it can generate getters and setters for those object automatically by using Lombok annotations.*
